    <h2>The Website</h2>
    <p>
        This website is a fork of this repository: <a href="https://github.com/nanotools/nanoNodeMonitor">original</a>.
        The fork can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/nifni/nanoNodeMonitor">fork</a>. I forked
        away because I wanted this frontend to be more simplistic than it was. For example I removed some Javascript
        libraries to make the side load faster and consume less traffic (especially on mobile). Also I did not find
        it important to show the current market situation for choosing me as a representative. That is why I removed the
        coinmarketcap widget.

        If you think about donating because of the sleek website, feel free to check out the original though.
        The contributors there did most of the work!

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        To choose a representative you trust I think it is most important that you trust the person who is running the
        node. Because of that I want to give you some personal information about me.
    </p>
    <p>
        My name is Nico Fricke and I am currently living in LÃ¼beck/Germany. I am into Nano since early December 2017.
        In the Nano Discord I am mainly around in the #support channel where you might have seen me. I am 22 years
        old and I work as a Software Developer in a middle sized company.
        You can find me on <a href="https://reddit.com/u/nifni">Reddit</a>,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/nifninif">Twitter</a>,
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035378497/">Steam</a>,
        <a href="https://t.me/@NiFNi">Telegram</a> and Discord (NiF#3422).
    </p>

    <h2>Why do I run this node?</h2>
    <p>
        I like hosting stuff. It is fun for me to setup something like this and keep it running as stable as possible.
        Also I like Nano. The tech behind it is so simple but also so awesome
        (check <a href="https://nano.org">nano.org</a> for more information on the tech).
        One problem that still exists is that there are only a small number of representatives which have most of
        the voting power. To change this I setup this node. And to make it easier for people to trust me with their
        voting power I give as much transparency as possible. So if you have any question remaining unanswered don't
        hesitate to contact me on any of the accounts mentioned in the about me section.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I keep sure the node is running 24/7?</h2>
    <p>
        This node is hosted on a root-server by <a href="https://netcup.eu">Netcup</a>. Netcup is a german hosting
        provider with which I never had any problems. Downtimes outside of scheduled security patches never happened.
        The scheduled downtimes were always communicated accordingly and took only some minutes until everything
        was up again.
        The underlying OS is a headless Ubuntu 16.04 which has been stable for me on many different servers and VMs.
        The hardware specification of this server is 2 dedicated CPU cores, 6GB RAM and a 40 GB SSD.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are checks running which will notify me the moment the node goes offline or is not reachable for
        any reason. I will always keep the node software updated as soon as there is a new release in place.
    </p>

    <h2>How can you support me?</h2>
    <p>
        If you want to rent anything from netcup feel free to contact me. I can give you referral keys which give you
        up to 30% discount while I get 10% of everything you pay to netcup. So it would be a great deal for both of
        us :P.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to support me directly you can donate me some Nano to the address at the bottom.

    <h2>How can you contact me?</h2>
    <p>
        For any open questions you can contact me on one of the channels mentioned in the "About Me" chapter. For the
        people who are not active on any of the mentioned platforms here is my email address:
        <a href="mailto:nano@nifni.net?subject=[Node]">Contact</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Why should you use me as your representative?</h2>
    <p>
        In the chapter above I described how I will make sure the node is running 24/7. Also I wrote a bit about me
        so that you know who I am and when checking my social network sites you can make sure that I am really who I
        claim I am. And last but not least I offer a e-mail list you can subscribe to. I will write about any updates
        concerning my node (don't worry I won't spam you). To subscribe just write an e-mail to
        <a href="mailto:nano@nifni.net?subject=[Node Newsletter]">nano@nifni.net</a> from the e-mail
        you want to subscribe with. You can always unsubscribe by just writing me that you want to unsubscribe.
